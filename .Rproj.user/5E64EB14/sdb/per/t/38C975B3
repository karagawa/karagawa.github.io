To get up and running with a new GitHub repository quickly, follow these steps or jump ahead to the [full installation guide]({{ base_path }}/docs/installation/).\n\n## Fork the Theme\n\nFork the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/fork), then rename the repo to **USERNAME.github.io** --- replacing **USERNAME** with your GitHub username.\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"{{ base_path }}/images/mm-theme-fork-repo.png\" alt=\"fork Minimal Mistakes\">\n</figure>\n\n**Note:** Your Jekyll site should be viewable immediately at <http://USERNAME.github.io>. If it's not, you can force a rebuild by **Customizing Your Site** (see below for more details).\n{: .notice--warning}\n\nIf you're hosting several Jekyll based sites under the same GitHub username you will have to use Project Pages instead of User Pages. Essentially you rename the repo to something other than **USERNAME.github.io** and create a `gh-pages` branch off of `master`. For more details on how to set things up check [GitHub's documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"{{ base_path }}/images/mm-gh-pages.gif\" alt=\"creating a new branch on GitHub\">\n</figure>\n\n**ProTip:** Be sure to [delete](https://github.com/blog/1377-create-and-delete-branches) the `gh-pages` branch if you forked Minimal Mistakes. This branch contains the documentation and demo site for the theme and you probably don't want that showing up in your repo.\n{: .notice--info}\n\n## Customize Your Site\n\nOpen up `_config.yml` found in the root of the repo and edit anything under **Site Settings**. For a full explanation of every setting be sure to read the [**Configuration**]({{ base_path }}/docs/configuration/) section, but for now let's just change the site's title.\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"{{ base_path }}/images/mm-github-edit-config.gif\" alt=\"editing _config.yml file\">\n  <figcaption>Edit text files without leaving GitHub.com</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nCommitting a change to `_config.yml` (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with Jekyll. It should then be viewable a few seconds later at `https://USERNAME.github.io`.\n\n---\n\nCongratulations! You've successfully forked the theme and are up an running with GitHub Pages. Now you're ready to add content and customize the site further.\n",
