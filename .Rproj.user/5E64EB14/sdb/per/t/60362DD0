As a typical student majoring in environmental science & engineering, I started my Ph.D. studying career by venturing into a completely new research sphere: environmental economics. My Ph.D. research focuses on non-market valuation on ecosystem service and cost-benefit analysis in an effort to better manage natural resources and to navigate policy-making processes in a scientific manner. I also have strong interests in applying the concept of Big Data into scientific research fields.\n\n\n\n",
