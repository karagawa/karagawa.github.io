Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nWhen you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n\n```r\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\n```\n##      speed           dist       \n##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00\n```\n\n## Including Plots\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n![plot of chunk pressure](/figure/source/Research/pressure-1.png)\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
