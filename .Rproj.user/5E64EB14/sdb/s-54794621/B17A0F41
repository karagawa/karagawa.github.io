New York State has more than 7,600 freshwater lakes, ponds and reservoirs. These waterbodies often serve as drinking water supplies for local communities and as habitat for aquatic plants and animals. They also support a wide range of human activities, including recreation, tourism, agriculture, fishing, power generation and manufacturing. Impaired water quality in large lakes in New York State reduces their ecological services and value to homeowners and visitors. In this study, links between water quality and property values as a result of acid and mercury deposition in New York State is established through hedonic analysis. \n\n<figure>\n\t<a href=\"/images/mercury.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/mercury.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Total Mercury Wed Deposition 1999~2013 </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nHedonic analysis uses regression techniques to estimate a hedonic price function, which represents the impact of observable property characteristics, including environmental amenities and spatial factors, on the equilibrium prices of parcels. By including observable characteristics, like lot size, square footage, and some information about the buyer, including their mailing address, the project will also be able to estimate how water quality factors impact the values of different types of homes in different ways.\n\n<figure>\n\t<a href=\"/images/hedonic.jpg\"><img src=\"/images/hedonic.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Hedonic Analysis   by Chuan Tang</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThis study is unique in its use of hedonic analysis to study these water quality factors and benefits from a large sample size and study area which allows for sufficient variation over both space and time in order to identify the effects on property values. In contrast to many previous hedonic studies, we use these specific measures, which have important ecosystem and human health implications, rather than clarity or other more aggregate measures for water quality. Moreover, this research will put dollar values to air pollution reductions, which is very useful in that it enables rigorous cost-benefit analyses to be performed as opposed to policymakers being forced to compare emissions controls cost figures from electric generating units with air and water quality metrics.
