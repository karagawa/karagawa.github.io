Economics valuations and further cost-benefit analysis based on environmental/biological monitoring data may reach spurious results and misleading conclusions if the true spatial and temporal trends are not properly distinguished from total variations of monitored objects complicated by sample heterogeneity. The research is an example of addressing this problem, aiming to provide credible data source for further economics valuations on mercury pollution. Consumption of mercury-contaminated fish is the major route through which human and wildlife are exposed to the threat of mercury. Unfortunately, effective economics analysis based on fish monitoring data is normally dampened by difficulties in distinguishing the true spatial and temporal trends from variation in fish-mercury concentrations caused by heterogeneity in fish samples(e.g., species, size, sex).

This research will put effort to evaluate the relative performance of several fish mercury standardization methods systematically: ANCOVA and Mutiple-Linear Regression, Bivariate Regression, Partial Least Squares Regression, Biotic Mercury Partitioning Index (BMPI)and the Empirical Transforming Model, serving as a clear guide to choose the “best” suitable model for further economics research involving fish mercury trend analysis. Results of this research will therefore contribute to (1) maximizing the utility of integrated monitoring databases with minimum uncertainty, (2) processing monitoring data efficiently and ensuring reliable trend analysis results which can be related back to economics valuations and emissions mitigation policies, and (3) proposing fish consumption advisories with validated references.
