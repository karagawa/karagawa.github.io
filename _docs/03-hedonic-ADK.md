The six-million-acre Adirondack Park in New York State is the largest designated park in the contiguous United States, consisting of approximately three million acres of private lands, 2.6 million acres of public land plus water bodies. This region constitutes nearly 20 percent of the state’s land area and is a mix of dense forests, mountains, wetlands, lakes, rivers and streams, with a diverse population of wildlife and 130 rural communities, 10 of which are incorporated villages. The park has 130,000 year-round residents and 200,000 seasonal residents. It attracts 10 million annual visitors. The Adirondack Park is accessible to over 60 million people who live within a day’s drive. The abundant natural resources and large preserved wilderness area have made the Adirondack Park a famous destination for outdoor activities like hiking, fishing, boating, as well as a notable natural lab for education and scientific research.

New York State continues to acquire additional land inside the Adirondack Park. The state recently bought much of the [former Finch, Pruyn lands](http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/42077.html) and will soon complete the purchase of the Boreas Ponds Tract. Once the state buys this tract, it’s up to the Adirondack Park Agency to determine how it will be managed by classifying it using one of the categories spelled out in the Adirondack Park State Land Master Plan. Broadly, Forest Preserve land can be designated as wilderness, which prohibits motorized recreation, or wild forest, which allows the use of motorized vehicles including snowmobiles, ATVs, and floatplanes.

Given recent and expected acquisitions of former timberlands in the Adirondack Park, the New York State DEC must designate newly-acquired land under the SLMP. There is a heated political debate about which land designation would be most beneficial to the park’s communities and economy. This research is aiming to better understand the economic value provided to the park's residents and communities by the various land use designations, and it will use property value impacts as a guide.
